# Warehouse-Simulator
This project simulates the operations of a warehouse using Object-Oriented Programming principles in C++. Originally submitted as a school project, the objective was to demonstrate our understanding and implementation of OOP concepts.

Having initially learned Java, which abstracts much of the memory management, this project places a strong emphasis on our proficiency with pointers, references, and correct memory management in C++. Special attention was given to avoiding memory leaks and ensuring efficient memory usage.
